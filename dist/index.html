          The world before my eyes is wan and wasted, just like me. The earth is
          decrepit, the sky stormy, all the grass withered. No spring breeze
          even at this late date, Just winter clouds swallowing up my tiny reed
          hut.

          The wind has settled, the blossoms have fallen; Birds sing, the

          The tree was barren of leaves but you brought a new spring. Long green
          sprouts, verdant flowers, fresh promise. Mori, if I ever forget my
          profound gratitude to you, Let me burn in hell forever.

          In a dilapidated three-room hut I've grown old and tired; This winter
          cold is the Worst I've ever suffered through. I sip thin gruel,
          waiting for the Freezing night to pass. Can I last until spring
          finally arrives? Unable to beg for rice, How will I survive the chill?
          Even meditation helps no longer; Nothing left to do but compose poems
          In memory of deceased friends.

          First blooming in the Western Paradise, The lotus has delighted us for
          ages. Its white petals are covered with dew, its jade green leaves
          spread out over the pond, And its pure fragrance perfumes the wind.
          Cool and majestic, it raises from the murky water. The sun sets behind
          the mountains But I remain in the darkness, too captivated to leave.

          My house is buried in the deepest recess of the forest Every year, ivy
          vines grow longer than the year before. Undisturbed by the affairs of
          the world I live at ease, Woodmen’s singing rarely reaching me through
          the trees. While the sun stays in the sky, I mend my torn clothes And
          facing the moon, I read holy texts aloud to myself. Let me drop a word
          of advice for believers of my faith. To enjoy life's immensity, you do
          not need many things.

          An old grave hidden away at the foot of a deserted hill, Overrun with
          rank weeds growing unchecked year after year; There is no one left to
          tend the tomb, And only an occasional woodcutter passes by. Once I was
          his pupil, a youth with shaggy hair, Learning deeply from him by the
          Narrow River.

          Too lazy to be ambitious, I let the world take care of itself. Ten
          days' worth of rice in my bag; a bundle of twigs by the fireplace. Why
          chatter about delusion and enlightenment? Listening to the night rain
          on my roof, I sit comfortably, with both legs stretched out.

          likes to smile to himself. I wade across streams with bony legs, And

          In my youth I put aside my studies And I aspired to be a saint. Living
          austerely as a mendicant monk, I wandered here and there for many
          springs. Finally I returned home to settle under a craggy peak. I live
          peacefully in a grass hut, Listening to the birds for music. Clouds
          are my best neighbors. Below a pure spring where I refresh body and
          mind; Above, towering pines and oaks that provide shade and brushwood.
          Free, so free, day after day -- I never want to leave!

          In stubborn stupidity, I live on alone befriended by trees and herbs.
          Too lazy to learn right from wrong, I laugh at myself, ignoring
          others. Lifting my bony shanks, I cross the stream, a sack in my hand,
          blessed by spring weather. Living thus, I want for nothing, at peace
          with all the world.

          Your finger points to the moon, but the finger is blind until the moon
          appears. What connection has moon and finger? Are they separate
          objects or bound? This is a question for beginners wrapped in seas of
          ignorance. Yet one who looks beyond metaphor knows there is no finger;
          there is no moon.

          Returning to my native village after many years’ absence: I put up at
          a country inn and listen to the rain. One robe, one bowl is all I
          have. I light incense and strain to sit in meditation; All night a
          steady drizzle outside the dark window &mdash; Inside, poignant
          memories of these long years of pilgrimage.

          The city lights flicker and gleam, But true peace is found in
          stillness. A leaf falling, a drop of dew, Remind us to let go and find
          beauty in the moment. The rat race of desire, A never-ending cycle of
          pain, Why chase after illusions, When true happiness is found within.
          Like a fish swimming in the depths of a clear pond, We must dive deep
          within ourselves, To discover the pearl of true contentment. So let us
          cast aside our wants and needs, And find solace in simplicity.

          The universe is a vast and mysterious place, and yet everything is
          interconnected, everything is energy. Einstein's theory of relativity
          tells us that matter and energy are interchangeable, that everything
          is made up of tiny particles of energy vibrating at different
          frequencies. And this means that every living being, every rock, every
          star, every molecule is connected by an invisible web of energy.

          It is not easy to let go of our attachment to material possessions and
          desires. It takes discipline, focus and a certain level of detachment
          from the world around us. But by taking the time to slow down and
          appreciate the beauty of nature, and by quieting the mind and
          listening to the inner voice, we can find the path to true
          fulfillment.
