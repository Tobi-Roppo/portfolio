              Then they opened the firmaments and the Light descended below to
              the lower regions and to those who were without form, having no
              true likeness. It was thus that they got the likeness of the Light
              for themselves. Some rejoiced because the Light had come to them,
              and that they had been made rich thereby. Others mourned because
              they were made poor and that which they thought they had was taken
              away from them. Thus came He, who went forth full of grace, and
              was taken captive with a captivity. A light of glory was given to
              the æons who had received the Spark, and guardian spirits were
              sent to them who are Gamanêl, Etrempsouchos, and Agramas, and
              those who are with them. They bring help to those who have
              believed in the Spark of Light.

              Now in the Space of the Indivisible Atom are twelve Founts, above
              which are the twelve Paternities who surround the Indivisible
              [Queen] like Deeps or like Skies and make for Her a crown in which
              is every kind of life: all modes of Triple-powered life, of
              Uncontainable life, of Infinite life, of Ineffable life, of Silent
              life, of Unknown life, of Solitary life, of Unshakable life, of
              First-manifested life, of Self-born life, of True life. All is
              therein. Every species is in it, all Gnôses and every power which
              has received the Light, yea, all Mind manifests itself therein.
              This is the Crown which the Father of the Universe has placed upon
              the Indivisible [Queen] with three hundred and sixty-five kinds in
              it, brilliant and filling the Universe with an incorruptible and
              unfailing light.
