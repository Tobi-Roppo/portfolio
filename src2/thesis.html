              Rice, a critical global crop, faces constant threats from insect
              pests, leading to substantial yield losses and economic impact.
              Pest control strategies rely on precise timing and monitoring,
              with artificial light traps proving valuable. Pesticide spraying,
              though common, demands caution during early plant growth due to
              toxicity. Accurate insect identification is vital for effective
              control. The study introduces an innovative stationary pest
              infestation monitoring device using Convolutional Neural Network
              and Raspberry Pi, achieving 78.4% accuracy but highlighting the
              need for further refinement.

              We developed an IoT-based system using a Raspberry Pi and a Pi cam
              to detect and classify rice adult-flying stage insects. The
              platform was designed with a focus on real-time monitoring, and
              the researchers used Roboflow for data labeling, data
              pre-processing, and data augmentation. We chose the YOLOv5
              architecture for insect detection and classification, which
              involved training the model on a dataset of approximately 1140
              labeled images. The platform successfully detected and classified
              insects in real-time and saved the results in JSON format. A
              user-friendly desktop app was created to display the data. Testing
              showed an impressive accuracy rate of 94.3%, with user and
              producer accuracy metrics, demonstrating the model's
              effectiveness. Furthermore, the study compared its results with a
              previous research effort by Cubillas et al. (2020), showcasing
              superior performance.

              We successfully developed a platform for real-time insect
              detection and classification using the YOLOv5 model. The
              platform's design and capabilities were thoroughly discussed, and
              it was demonstrated that the system could accurately identify and
              categorize insects. The accuracy of the YOLOv5 model was measured
              using various metrics, resulting in an impressive overall accuracy
              rate of 94.3%. The study also compared its accuracy with a
              previous research effort, showcasing its superior performance.
              Overall, Chapter 4 highlighted the successful implementation and
              effectiveness of the developed system in insect monitoring for
              rice fields.
